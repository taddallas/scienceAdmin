This repo contains some files I find useful when initiating projects and formatting cover letters (especially if you're in the U California system), along with a bunch of randomly acquired LaTeX bst and csl files for bibliography formatting. I'll eventually turn this into something a bit more concrete and well defined. 


Until then, feel free to use "as-is".
